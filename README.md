# HPC_Programs
The HPC programs repository is a group of helpful guides that are useful for working with an HPC. 

# Requirements
To run a program on an HPC, one must have a username, password, and method of accessing the HPC (shell, web browser, etc.). The program that is desired must also be installed on the HPC. This repository **does not** cover program installation, but rather utilization on the user side. 

Please note that this guide will not always be 100% accurate to a fault. HPC systems are very diverse, with hardware, program installation, topography, and many other aspects differing from system to system.
